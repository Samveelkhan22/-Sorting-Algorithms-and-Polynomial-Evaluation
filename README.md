# Sorting Algorithms and Polynomial Evaluation

This project demonstrates the implementation of sorting algorithms and polynomial evaluation using Python. The repository includes custom implementations of sorting techniques and evaluates a polynomial at a given value of `x`.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following tasks:
1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Custom implementations of modified selection sort and bubble sort algorithms. The algorithms output the number of comparisons and swaps made during each iteration.
2. **Polynomial Evaluation**: A function that evaluates a polynomial at a specific value of `x`.

## Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented:

### 1. Modified Selection Sort:
This algorithm sorts an array in increasing order. It outputs the array after each iteration, showing how many comparisons and swaps were made during the sorting process.

### 2. Modified Bubble Sort:
The bubble sort is enhanced to stop early if the array is already sorted before completing all iterations.

### Input Arrays:

The program sorts six predefined arrays (A1 to A6), which are processed as part of the task. For each array, the number of comparisons and swaps is tracked.
